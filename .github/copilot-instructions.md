When generating a commit message, follow the Conventional Commits format. The commit message should be structured as follows:

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]
```

The type should be one of the following:

```json
{
  "types": {
    "feat": {
      "description": "A new feature",
      "title": "Features"
    },
    "fix": {
      "description": "A bug fix",
      "title": "Bug Fixes"
    },
    "docs": {
      "description": "Documentation only changes",
      "title": "Documentation"
    },
    "style": {
      "description": "Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)",
      "title": "Styles"
    },
    "refactor": {
      "description": "A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature",
      "title": "Code Refactoring"
    },
    "perf": {
      "description": "A code change that improves performance",
      "title": "Performance Improvements"
    },
    "test": {
      "description": "Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests",
      "title": "Tests"
    },
    "build": {
      "description": "Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)",
      "title": "Builds"
    },
    "ci": {
      "description": "Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)",
      "title": "Continuous Integrations"
    },
    "chore": {
      "description": "Other changes that don't modify src or test files",
      "title": "Chores"
    },
    "revert": {
      "description": "Reverts a previous commit",
      "title": "Reverts"
    }
  }
}
```

The scope should be the name of the feature affected by the change (e.g. `calendar`, `auth`, `habit`, `note`, `layout`, etc.). The scope can also be omitted if the change affects multiple features.

The body should consist of a short description of the change (up to three sentences) and a list of any breaking changes.
